# CouponMarketing-Database
Business Application Description

1.1 Introduction

Marketing is integral to the success of a business, from customer acquisition to customer loyalty and customer churn management.  To successfully increase customer loyalty and reduce customer churn with a coupon marketing campaign, it is important to identify customers to target--those who will use the coupon to make a purchase, remain engaged with the company, and ideally, be incentivized by the coupon to make larger purchases.  If a coupon marketing campaign is successful in increasing purchase quantity and amount ($), we will also need to ensure that inventory of popular products matches the demand.  Furthermore, inventory will be relevant to a coupon marketing campaign since products with a lot of inventory would be good candidates for a promotion, in order to help clear shelves.   
Thus, a database managing customer behavior with respect to coupon offerings as well as inventory helps the company not only to efficiently target customers for a profitable coupon marketing campaign, but also to meet the current demand for specific products. 

1.2 Objective 

The objectives of the Ecommerce Management System are listed as following: 
Target customers identification –  To more efficiently identify customers to target with marketing campaigns to increase sales, and to aid marketing analysts in model building by providing customer behavior data.
Warehouse Management for Coupon Marketing – To use warehouse inventory information to determine which products have too much inventory and would therefore be good candidates for promotions.  

1.3 Scope

For the purpose of this project, this Coupon Marketing System will only work for an independent E-commerce company selling women’s shoes. We will design this database specifically with the coupon marketing problem in mind, rather than for all business problems related to E-commerce sites.
